When procrastinating remember that motivation follows action, not the other way around.

People will remember not what you said, but how you made them feel.

You would worry less about what other people think if you if you realized how seldom they do.

Long term consistency trumps short term intensity.

It is not all over; everything has not been invented; the human adventure is just beginning.
